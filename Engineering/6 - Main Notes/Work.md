# Work

Work or energy is the Joule. One Joule is equal to one newton meter. Joule is defined as the work done or energy transferred when a force of one newton is exerted through a distance one on meter in the direction of force. 

$$
W = Fs
$$
W is the work in Joules, F is Force in newtons, s is the distance in meters moved by the body in the direction of force.
