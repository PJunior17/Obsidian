# Assembly Language

Also known as Assembly, is a human readable language meant to interface [[Machine Code]] for humans and machines. Each instruction is identified by a short abbreviation rather than in [[Binary]]. Assembly programs must be translated to [[Machine Code]] before it is executed. This is done with a program called an [[Assembler]]. Each CPU family has it's own machine language and there for has it's own assembly language as well.
