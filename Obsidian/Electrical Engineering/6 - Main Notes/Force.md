# Force

The unit of force is measured in newtons (N) where one newton is equal to one kilogram meter per second squared. 

$$
F = ma
$$
Where F is is the force in newtons, m is mass in kilograms, and a is acceleration in meters per second squared. 

Gravitational Force is measured as mg 
$$
g = 9.81 m/s^2
$$
